\arguments{
\item{basin}{character. Name of basin where the Storms should be extracted.
Default value is set to \code{"SP"}}

\item{time_period}{numerics. Should be either one cyclonic season or a range
of cyclonic season. It could also be a vector of cyclonic season provided
that it has the same length as \code{name} and matches the season of each Storm
listed in \code{name}. Default value is set to c(1980, 2021)}

\item{name}{characters. Name(s) of Storm(s). Default value is set to NULL,
otherwise \code{time_period} and \code{name} must have the same length, and these two
informations must match}

\item{loi}{Location of Interest. Should be either a \code{SpatialPolygon}, a \code{sf}
object, a point of coordinates in lon/lat, a character representing a country,
or a basin. Default value is set to \code{NULL} which will set the \code{spatial.loi.}
on the whole \code{basin}}

\item{max_dist}{numeric. Indicates the buffer used buffer to generate
\code{spatail.loi.buffer} (in km). Default value is set to 300}

\item{verbose}{logical. Whether or not the function must be verbose and display
a text progress bar. Default value is set to \code{FALSE}}

\item{remove_TD}{logical. Whether or not to remove Tropical Depression (< 18 m/s).
