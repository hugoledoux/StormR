\usage{
getStorm(sts, name, season = NULL)

\S4method{getStorm}{StormsList}(sts, name, season = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sts}{\code{StormsList}}

\item{name}{character. Name of the storm to extract.}

\item{season}{numeric vector. Seasons of occurrence of the storms (e.g., c(2020,2022)). In the Southern Hemisphere,
the cyclone season extends across two consecutive years. Therefore, to capture the 2021 to 2022 cyclone season both
years should be specified, with cyclones assigned for the year that originated in. By default all storms occurring since
1980 are extracted.}
}
\value{
The \code{getStorm()} function returns a \code{Storm} object.
}
\description{
The \code{getStorm()} function extracts a specific \code{Storm} object from a \code{StormsList} object.
