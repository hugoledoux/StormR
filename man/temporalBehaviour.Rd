\usage{
temporalBehaviour(
  sts,
  points,
  product = "TS",
  wind_threshold = c(18, 33, 42, 49, 58, 70),
  method = "Willoughby",
  asymmetry = "Chen",
  empirical_rmw = FALSE,
  temp_res = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{sts}{StormsList object}

\item{points}{data.frame. Contains longitude/latitude coordinates within
column names "lon" and "lat", on which to compute the desired product}

\item{product}{character. Product to compute. Must be either:
\itemize{
\item "TS": Time Series of wind speed
\item "PDI": Power Dissipation Index
\item "Exposure": hour exposition for wind greater than wind_threshold
input
}
Default value is set to "TS"}

\item{wind_threshold}{numeric vector. Minimal wind threshold(s) (m/s) to
compute Exposure product. Ignored if Exposure is not part of the products to
compute. Default value is set to Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale thresholds}

\item{method}{character. Cyclonic model used to compute product. Must be
either:
\itemize{
\item "Willoughby": model based on fits performed on cyclonic observations
\item "Holland": model based on both basic cyclonic Physics and parameters
fitting according to cyclonic observations
\item "Boose": asymmetric model based on Holland model
}
Default value is set to "Willoughby" (See Details)}

\item{asymmetry}{character. Indicates which version of asymmetry to use in
the computations. Must be either:
\itemize{
\item "Miyazaki": ...
\item "Chen": ...
\item "None": no asymmetry is added
}
Default value is set to "Chen" (See Details)}

\item{empirical_rmw}{logical. Whether to compute the radius of maximum wind
empirically or using the radius of maximum wind from the observations.
Default value is set to FALSE. If TRUE, a formula extracted from Willoughby
et al. 2006 is used to compute rmw}

\item{temp_res}{numeric. Period of time used to interpolate data.
Allowed values are 1 (60min), 0.75 (45min), 0.5 (30min), and 0.25 (15min).
Default value is set to 1}

\item{verbose}{numeric. Whether or not the function should display
informations about the process and/or outputs and additional notes.
Allowed values are:
\itemize{
\item 0: Nothing is displayed
\item 1: Informations about the process are displayed
}
Default value is set to 1}
}
\value{
Computed product for each points are returned through data.frames
contained in a named list. Each slot, named after the storm, is a data.frame
that has the following dimensions:
\itemize{
\item If product == "TS": a data frame whose number of rows corresponds to
the number of interpolated observations. The columns provides
respectively the wind speed values (m/s), the wind directions
(in degree), the indices and the ISO time of observation
\item If product == "PDI": a data.frame with one row and one column that
contains PDI value for each point in points.
\item If product == "Exposure": a data.frame with one row for each wind
threshold and one column that contains Exposure value for each point
in points.
}
}
\description{
This function is the pointwise version of spatialBehaviour. Available
products are Time Series of wind speed (TS), Power Dissipation Index (PDI)
and Exposure
