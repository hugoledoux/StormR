## Overview

StormR is a package developed to analyze past storms and tropical cyclones that occurred anywhere in the world after 1980. It allows users to compute cyclone characteristics (e.g., maximum sustained wind speed, exposure period), gather storms of interest in a single object, rasterize available data, and plot maps of cyclone tracks and charateristics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of StormR as follows:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("umr-amap/StormR")
```


## Data source
StormR uses the netcdf file 'IBTrACS.ALL.v04r00.nc' from the [International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive). This package extracts the information needed to plot, compute and analyze tropical cyclones from this database. The IBTrACS database provides records of storms and tropical cyclones around the world every 3 hours since 1841 (note that data for the most recent storms may not be available yet and that not all storms of the earlier years are captured). Recods in the database are derived from various agencies in the USA and uses the following names and abbrevaitions for the world's ocean basins:
* NA : North Atlantic
* SA : South Atlantic
* EP : Eastern North Pacific
* WP : Western North Pacific
* SP : South Pacific
* SI : South Indian
* NI : North Indian
* ALL: the above 7 basins combined

in the StormR package, the default value for the basin is set to SP, as the developpement team is located/interested in this particular region and because this basin has been used to test the package. However, the user can select a different basin.
For the purpose of data reliability and accuracy, StormR only faciltates access to storms and tropical cyclones after 1980. Data for older storms is spatially less accurate and may therefore produce errors: you can [Click here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/IBTrACS_version4_Technical_Details.pdf) for more details on data limitations of the IBTrACS database.

## Models

StormR allows computing radial wind speed using two cyclonic models:

$\textbf{Willoughby et al. 2006}$ <br />
Insert comments about the model here <br />


$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
v_r &= msw\left(\frac{r}{rmw}\right)^{nn} \quad if \quad r < rmw \\
v_r &= msw\left((1-AA))e^{-\frac{|r-rmw|}{XX1}} + AA e^{-\frac{|r-rmw|}{XX2}}\right) \quad if \quad r \geq rmw \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$


where <br />
$v_r \quad$ Radial wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$r \quad$ Distance to the eye of the storm where $v_r$ is computed $(km)$ <br />
$msw \quad$ Maximum sustained wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$rmw \quad$ Radius of maximum sustained wind speed $(km)$ <br />
$XX1 = 287.6 - 1.942msw + 7.799\log(rmw) + 1.819|\phi| \quad$ Coefficient, $\phi$ being the latitude <br />
$XX2 = 25 \quad$ Coefficient <br />
$nn = 2.1340 + 0.0077msw - 0.4522\log(rmw) - 0.0038|\phi| \quad$ Coefficient, $\phi$ being the latitude <br />



$\textbf{Holland 1980}$ <br />
Insert comments about the model here <br />


$$
v_r = \sqrt{\frac{b}{\rho}\left(\frac{rmw}{r}\right)^b (poci - pc)e^{-\left(\frac{rmw}{r}\right)^b} + \left(\frac{rf}{2}\right)^2} - \left(\frac{rf}{2}\right)
$$

where <br />
$v_r \quad$ Radial wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$r \quad$ Distance to the eye of the storm where $v_r$ is computed $(km)$ <br />
$msw \quad$ Maximum sustained wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$rmw \quad$ Radius of maximum sustained wind speed $(km)$ <br />
$pc \quad$ Pressure at the eye of the storm $(mb)$ <br />
$poci \quad$ Pressure at Outermost Closed Isobar of the storm $(mb)$ <br />
$\rho = 1.15 \quad$ Air density $(kg.m^{-3})$ <br />
$f = 2 \times 7.29 \times10^{-5} \sin(\phi) \quad$ Coriolis force $(N.kg^{-1})$, $\phi$ being the latitude <br />
$b = \frac{\rho e \times msw^2}{poci - pc} \quad$ Shape factor <br />



It is also possible to use an empirical formula derived from Willoughby et al. 2006 model
to compute the radius of maximum wind speed, as follow: <br />
$rmw = 46.4e^{(-0.0155msw + 0.0169|\phi|)}$




## Asymmetry

The above models compute symmetric 2D structures of radial wind speed around the
eye of the storm. Nevertheless, in most cases, tropical cyclone are not symmetric
and it can be interesting to add asymmetry to the computations in order to get a
much more accurate 2D structures of radial wind speed. This package proposes two formula
to add such asymmetries: <br />

$\textbf{Version 1 (Boose et al. 2001 version)}$ <br />
Insert comments here  <br />
$v_{r_{as}} = v_r - S(1-\sin(\alpha))\frac{v_h}{2}$

$\textbf{Version 2}$ <br />
Insert comments here  <br />
$v_{r_{as}} = v_{r_{|v_h}} + v_h\cos(\theta)$

where <br />
$v_{r_{as}} \quad$ New radial wind speed with asymmetry $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$v_r \quad$ Former radial wind speed without asymmetry $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$v_h \quad$ Velocity of storm $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$v_{r_{|v_h}} \quad$ Former radial wind speed without asymmetry $(m.s^{-1})$, where values
have been computed substracting $v_h$ to $msw$ i.e $v_{max} = msw-v_h$ in the input
$S$ Asymmetry coefficient (usually set to 1) <br />
$\alpha \quad$ Angle between the storm direction and the point where $v_{r_{as}}$ is computed.
Clockwise in Nothern hemisphere, counterclokwise in Southern hemisphere. <br />
$\theta \quad$ Angle between the storm direction and the direction of radial wind speed at the point where $v_{r_{as}} \quad$ is computed <br />

## Products
StormR let the user compute several products. They can either be computed on
specific longitude/latitute coordinates or rasterized over the location of interest.
The following describes the products available: <br />


* Maximum Sustained Wind speed (MSW). It provides the value of the maximum sustained wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$
  at distance $r$ of the eye of the storm according to

$$
\max(v_r(t) | t \in [0,T])
$$

  where $T$ stands for the whole lifecycle of the storm. <br />

* Power Dissipation Index (PDI): It provides the value of the PDI at distance $r$ of the eye of the     storm according to

$$
\int_T \rho C_d v_r^3 dt
$$

  $T$ stands for the whole lifecycle of the storm, $\rho$ represents the air density fixed here at      $10^{-3}$ $kg.m^{-3}$ ? Finally, $C_d$ models the drag coefficient of the storm. Although there exist       various methods and formula to compute this parameter that are widely debatable, we chose here the     following parametrization derived in [Wang, G., Wu, L., Mei, W. et al. Ocean currents show global     intensification of weak tropical cyclones. Nature 611, 496â€“500 (2022)](     https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05326-4):

$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
C_d &= (0.8 + 0.06v_r) \times 10^{-3} \quad if \quad v_r \leq 31.5 \\
C_d &= \left(0.55 + 2.97\frac{v_r}{31.5} - 1.49\left(\frac{v_r}{31.5}\right)^2\right) \times 10^{-3} \quad if \quad v_r > 31.5 \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

* Exposure: It provides the time exposure (in hours) for a given category $C$ (in the Saffir Simpson     Hurricane Scale), where radial wind speed $v_r^C$ spans in $C_r := [\min(v_r^c | c = C):\max(v_r^c | c = C)]$ , and at distance $r$ of the eye of the storm, according to

$$
\int_T c(v_r) dt
$$

$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
c(v_r) &= 1 \quad if \quad v_r \in C_r\\
c(v_r) &= 0 \quad if \quad v_r \notin C_r\\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

  where $T$ stands for the whole lifecycle of the storm. <br />
