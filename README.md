## Overview

StormR is a R package allowing to easily extract tropical cyclone data for given locations or areas of interests, generate tropical cyclone wind fields, and to compute statistics characterising the behaviour of tropical cyclone winds (maximum sustained wind speed, power dissipation index, time of exposure to different wind speeds).

## Usage

### Installing StormR package from GitHub

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("umr-amap/StormR")
```

### Loading StormR package

``` r
library(StormR)
```

### Getting and ploting tropical cyclone track data

The getStorms function allows to get track data for a given tropical cyclone or a set of tropical cyclones nearby a given location of interest (by default up to 300 km around the specified location of interest). The location of interest can be a country, a specific point or set of points defined by their longitude and latitude coordinates, or any user imported or defined spatial polygon shapefiles. Users can also select tropical cyclones with their names or season of occurrence. The plotStorms can then be used to visualise the trajectories and points of observation of tropical cyclones on a map.

E.g. getting data on the tropical cyclone PAM (2015) nearby Vanuatu  

``` r
st <- getStorms(loi = "Vanuatu", names = "PAM")
plotStorms(st, labels=TRUE)
```

E.g. getting data on all tropical cyclones nearby Nouméa (longitude = 166.45, latitude = -22.27) since 1980 and only plotting category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones (Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale) or tropical cyclone Niran.

``` r
pt <- c(166.45,-22.27)
st <- getStorms(loi = pt)
plotStorms(st, category = c(4,5), labels=TRUE)
plotStorms(st, names="NIRAN", labels=TRUE)
```

E.g. getting data on all tropical cyclones nearby an area defined using an imported shape file, here the exclusive economic zone of New Caledonia, between 2010 and 2020.

``` r
sp <- eezNC
st <- getStorms(loi = eezNC, season=c(2010,2020))
plotStorms(st, labels=FALSE)
```

### Computing and plotting 2D wind fields  

The stormBehaviour_sp function allows computing 2D tropical cyclone wind fields using parametric models at different spatial and temporal resolutions (the default spatial resolution is 2.5 $min$, i.e. ~4.5 $km$ at the equator and the default temporal resolution is 1 $h$). Then using the "Profiles" product of the stormBehaviour_sp function and the plotBehaviour function allows plotting 2D wind profile at a given time of observation.

E.g. computing and plotting 2D wind profiles generated by the topical cyclone Pam (2015) near the island of Efate (Vanuatu)

``` r
st <- getStorms(loi = "Vanuatu", names = "PAM")
profile <- stormBehaviour_sp(st, product = "Profiles")
plotBehaviour(st,profile[["PAM_Profiles_41"]])
```

### Computing and plotting time series of wind speed and direction

The temporalBehaviour function allows computing wind speed and direction for a given location or set of locations (provided with a data frame with "long" and "lat" columns) along the lifespan of a tropical cyclone.

E.g. computing and plotting time series of the speed and direction of winds generated by the topical cyclone Pam (2015) at Efate (longitude = 168.33, latitude = -17.73) in Vanuatu.

``` r
df<-data.frame(lon=168.33,lat=-17.73)
st <- getStorms(loi = "Vanuatu", names = "PAM")
ts <- temporalBehaviour(st, points = df)
plot(ts$PAM[,1]~ts$PAM[,3],type="b",xlab="Observation ID",ylab="Wind speed (m/s)")
plot(ts$PAM[,2]~ts$PAM[,3],type="b",xlab="Observation ID",ylab="Wind direction (degree north)")
```

### Computing, plotting, and exporting wind behaviour products

Beside computing 2D tropical cyclone wind fields, the stormBehaviour_sp function allows computing different products allowing to characterise the behaviour of winds across time and space. Three products are available: maximum sustained wind speed, power dissipation index, and time of exposure above a minimum wind speed threshold. These products can be plotted using the plotBehaviour function or exported as raster files using the writeRast function.

E.g. computing and plotting 2D maximum sustained wind speed, power dissipation index, and time of exposure to category 3 or higher (>49 $m.s^{-1}$) winds generated by the topical cyclone Pam (2015) nearby Vanuatu.

#Load the data for the tropical cyclone Pam which hit the Vanuatu in 2015
st <- Storms(loi = "Vanuatu", names = "PAM")

``` r

#Compute maximum sustained wind speed (MSW), power dissipation index (PDI), and exposure time (EXP) with default settings (the analytic model from Willoughby et al. 2006 with asymmetry). The function returns a raster with a 2.5min spatial resolution by default.
st_prod <- spatialBehaviour(st, product = c("MSW", "PDI", "Exposure"))


#Plot the MSW, PDI, and an Exposure rasters alongside with the track of the storm and the limit of the location of interest
split.screen(c(1,3))
screen(1)
plotBehaviour(st, st_prod[["PAM_MSW"]], labels = T)
screen(2)
plotBehaviour(st, st_prod[["PAM_PDI"]], labels = T)
screen(3)
plotBehaviour(st, st_prod[["PAM_Exposure_50"]], labels = T)


#Export the MSW raster in a given directory (here a temporary directory)
writeRast(st_prod[["PAM_MSW"]], path = paste0(tempdir(),"/"))
