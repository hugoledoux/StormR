## Overview

StormR is a package developped to analyze past storms and tropical cyclones that occured in the whole
world beyond 1980. It let the user gather all its interested storms in a single object and then use it
to either plot tracks on a map, or compute/rasterize regimes of wind speed, 2D structures of radial wind and various other products.

## Installation

You can install the development version of StormR like so:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("umr-amap/StormR")
```


## Data source 
StormR uses the netcdf file 'IBTrACS.ALL.v04r00.nc' that comes from the [International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive). It let this package get every informations needed to plot, compute and analyze tropical cyclones. This data base provides observations every 3 hours of storms and tropical cyclones on the whole world that occured from 1841 to present days (although observations of most recent storms are not available yet). Observations are derived from various agencies, nevertheless, this package only supplies observations extracted from the USA agency as it is the one that comes up with the most prolific and reliable data. The following lists all the basin names:

* NA : North Atlantic
* SA : South Atlantic
* EP : Eastern North Pacific
* WP : Western North Pacific
* SP : South Pacific
* SI : South Indian
* NI : North Indian
* ALL: the above 7 basins all together

Default value for the basin is set to SP as the developpement team is located/interested in this particular region, and this basin has been used to test this package but it is up to the user to select his basin of interest.
For the sake of data reliability, StormR focuses only on storms and tropical cyclones that occured beyond 1980. A research for older storms will result in an error. [Click here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/IBTrACS_version4_Technical_Details.pdf) for a deeper insight on the documentation of this 'IBTrACS.ALL.v04r00.nc' file.

## Models

Two cyclonic models are available within this package in order to compute radial wind speed:

$\textbf{Willoughby et al. 2006}$ <br />
Insert comments about the model here <br />


$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
v_r &= msw\left(\frac{r}{rmw}\right)^{nn} \quad if \quad r < rmw \\
v_r &= msw\left((1-AA))e^{-\frac{|r-rmw|}{XX1}} + AA e^{-\frac{|r-rmw|}{XX2}}\right) \quad if \quad r \geq rmw \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$


where <br />
$v_r \quad$ Radial wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$r \quad$ Distance to the eye of the storm where $v_r$ is computed $(km)$ <br />
$msw \quad$ Maximum sustained wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$rmw \quad$ Radius of maximum sustained wind speed $(km)$ <br />
$XX1 = 287.6 - 1.942msw + 7.799\log(rmw) + 1.819|\phi| \quad$ Coefficient, $\phi$ being the latitude <br />
$XX2 = 25 \quad$ Coefficient <br />
$nn = 2.1340 + 0.0077msw - 0.4522\log(rmw) - 0.0038|\phi| \quad$ Coefficient, $\phi$ being the latitude <br />



$\textbf{Holland 1980}$ <br />
Insert comments about the model here <br />


$$
v_r = \sqrt{\frac{b}{\rho}\left(\frac{rmw}{r}\right)^b (poci - pc)e^{-\left(\frac{rmw}{r}\right)^b} + \left(\frac{rf}{2}\right)^2} - \left(\frac{rf}{2}\right)
$$

where <br />
$v_r \quad$ Radial wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$r \quad$ Distance to the eye of the storm where $v_r$ is computed $(km)$ <br />
$msw \quad$ Maximum sustained wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$rmw \quad$ Radius of maximum sustained wind speed $(km)$ <br />
$pc \quad$ Pressure at the eye of the storm $(mb)$ <br />
$poci \quad$ Pressure at Outermost Closed Isobar of the storm $(mb)$ <br />
$\rho = 1.15 \quad$ Air density $(kg.m^{-3})$ <br />
$f = 2 \times 7.29 \times10^{-5} \sin(\phi) \quad$ Coriolis force $(N.kg^{-1})$, $\phi$ being the latitude <br />
$b = \frac{\rho e \times msw^2}{poci - pc} \quad$ Shape factor <br />



It is also possible to use an empirical formula derived from Willoughby et al. 2006 model
to compute the radius of maximum wind speed, as follow: <br />
$rmw = 46.4e^{(-0.0155msw + 0.0169|\phi|)}$




## Asymmetry

The above models compute symmetric 2D structures of radial wind speed around the
eye of the storm. Nevertheless, in most cases, tropical cyclone are not symmetric
and it can be interesting to add asymmetry to the computations in order to get a
much more accurate 2D structures of radial wind speed. This package proposes two formula
to add such asymmetries: <br />

$\textbf{Version 1 (Boose et al. 2001 version)}$ <br />
Insert comments here  <br />
$v_{r_{as}} = v_r - S(1-\sin(\alpha))\frac{v_h}{2}$

$\textbf{Version 2}$ <br />
Insert comments here  <br />
$v_{r_{as}} = v_{r_{|v_h}} + v_h\cos(\theta)$

where <br />
$v_{r_{as}} \quad$ New radial wind speed with asymmetry $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$v_r \quad$ Former radial wind speed without asymmetry $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$v_h \quad$ Velocity of storm $(m.s^{-1})$ <br />
$v_{r_{|v_h}} \quad$ Former radial wind speed without asymmetry $(m.s^{-1})$, where values
have been computed substracting $v_h$ to $msw$ i.e $v_{max} = msw-v_h$ in the input
$S$ Asymmetry coefficient (usually set to 1) <br />
$\alpha \quad$ Angle between the storm direction and the point where $v_{r_{as}}$ is computed.
Clockwise in Nothern hemisphere, counterclokwise in Southern hemisphere. <br />
$\theta \quad$ Angle between the storm direction and the direction of radial wind speed at the point where $v_{r_{as}} \quad$ is computed <br />

## Products
StormR let the user compute several products. They can either be computed on 
specific longitude/latitute coordinates or rasterized over the location of interest.
The following describes the products available: <br />


* Maximum Sustained Wind speed (MSW). It provides the value of the maximum sustained wind speed $(m.s^{-1})$
  at distance $r$ of the eye of the storm according to 
  
$$
\max(v_r(t) | t \in [0,T])
$$

  where $T$ stands for the whole lifecycle of the storm. <br />

* Power Dissipation Index (PDI): It provides the value of the PDI at distance $r$ of the eye of the     storm according to

$$
\int_T \rho C_d v_r^3 dt
$$

  $T$ stands for the whole lifecycle of the storm, $\rho$ represents the air density fixed here at      $10^{-3}$ $kg.m^{-3}$ ? Finally, $C_d$ models the drag coefficient of the storm. Although there exist       various methods and formula to compute this parameter that are widely debatable, we chose here the     following parametrization derived in [Wang, G., Wu, L., Mei, W. et al. Ocean currents show global     intensification of weak tropical cyclones. Nature 611, 496â€“500 (2022)](     https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05326-4): 
  
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
C_d &= (0.8 + 0.06v_r) \times 10^{-3} \quad if \quad v_r \leq 31.5 \\
C_d &= \left(0.55 + 2.97\frac{v_r}{31.5} - 1.49\left(\frac{v_r}{31.5}\right)^2\right) \times 10^{-3} \quad if \quad v_r > 31.5 \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

* Exposure: It provides the time exposure (in hours) for a given category $C$ (in the Saffir Simpson     Hurricane Scale), where radial wind speed $v_r^C$ spans in $C_r := [\min(v_r^c | c = C):\max(v_r^c | c = C)]$ , and at distance $r$ of the eye of the storm, according to 

$$
\int_T c(v_r) dt
$$ 

$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
c(v_r) &= 1 \quad if \quad v_r \in C_r\\
c(v_r) &= 0 \quad if \quad v_r \notin C_r\\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

  where $T$ stands for the whole lifecycle of the storm. <br />
